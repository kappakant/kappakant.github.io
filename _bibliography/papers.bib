  title={Is Less Really More? Fake News Detection with Limited Information},

  abstract={... We propose a framework called SLIM (Systematically-selected Limited Information) for fake news detection. In SLIM, we quantify the amount of information by introducing information-theoretic measures. SLIM leverages limited information (e.g., a few named entities) to achieve performance in fake news detection comparable to that of state-of-the-art obtained using the full text, even when the dataset is sparse. Furthermore, by combining various types of limited information, SLIM can perform even better while significantly reducing the quantity of information required for training compared to state-of-the-art language model-based fake news detection techniques.}
